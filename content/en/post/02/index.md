## 📅 Week of May 27 – June 2

The busiest week of the month — the first assessments have begun.

- 💻 **Programming**: Took a written test — the task was to implement a simple text editor in C++. There were many bugs at first, but I worked through them and even got an "A"!
- 🔢 **Mathematical Logic**: Passed a midterm. The questions involved logic algebra, disjunctive normal forms, and the resolution method. It was tough, but preparation paid off.
- 🧮 **Mathematical Analysis**: Continued working with derivatives. We started studying applications — extrema, inflection points, and graph concavity.
- 🏃‍♂️ **Physical Education**: Took a fitness test and participated in team competitions in the gym. Working on endurance and consistency.
