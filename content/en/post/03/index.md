## 📅 Week of June 3–9

Final exam season is approaching — time to wrap up the main topics.

- 🧠 **Programming**: Completed a lab on working with files and data structures. The submission was done on a computer using VS Code and the terminal.
- 📈 **Mathematical Analysis**: Took a mock exam — problems on integrals, substitution method, and integration by parts. Reviewing mistakes and refreshing the theory.
- 🔍 **Logic**: Studying predicate calculus and quantifiers. The material is complex but very structured. Started using LaTeX to format solutions.
- 🏋️ **Physical Education**: Last week of training. Passed the final test: a set of agility exercises and a timed run. Final grade — ✔️
