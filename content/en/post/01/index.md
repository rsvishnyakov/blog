## 📅 Week of May 20–26

This week was marked by active preparation for the upcoming exam session.  
Here’s what I managed to accomplish:

- 🧠 **Programming**: We explored recursion and implemented our first merge sort algorithms. It wasn’t easy at first, but after several hands-on sessions things became much clearer.
- 📐 **Mathematical Analysis**: Finished the topic of limits and moved on to derivatives. Worked on problems with parameters and focused on graphical interpretations of functions.
- 🔎 **Mathematical Logic**: Built logical expressions, got familiar with normal forms, and completed our first homework on formula transformations.
- 🏃 **Physical Education**: Completed a 1000-meter run and participated in strength and flexibility testing. Took part in a team relay — not a bad result!
