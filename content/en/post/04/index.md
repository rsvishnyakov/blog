## ðŸ“… Week of June 10â€“16

ðŸ”¥ Peak of the exam session â€” three exams in one week!

- ðŸŽ“ **Mathematical Analysis**: The exam went smoothly. It included problems on integrals, series, and function behavior analysis. All the preparation paid off!
- ðŸ’» **Programming**: The exam was in the form of a design task â€” we had to build a mini-CRM with filtering and sorting capabilities. I used structures and pointers.
- ðŸ§  **Mathematical Logic**: A tough exam with problems on proofs and logical calculi. It required not only knowledge but also quick thinking.
- ðŸ§˜ **Physical Education**: No classes this week, but light activities like park runs and stretching between exams really helped to reduce stress.
