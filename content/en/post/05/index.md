## 📅 Week of June 17–23

Final week of the academic year. Time to sum things up:

- 📊 All grades are in: “excellent” in programming and math, “good” in logic. Very satisfied!
- ✍️ Took short notes for each subject to preserve the structure of knowledge.
- 🧹 Cleaned up my folders and organized all study materials.
- 💡 Started planning the summer: aiming to dive deeper into Python and improve my SQL and data analysis skills.
- ☀️ A bit of rest — walks, books, and recharging for the next semester!
